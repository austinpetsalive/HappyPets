# HappyPets
HappyPets is an Agumented Reality App that allows viewing videos overlayed on sheets of paper to show how happy pets who are normally seen in cages can look.

The idea is that individuals who are looking at animals in the shelter may not get the best representation of the animal's average behavior (which is likely to be much happier than while they are in a cage). In order to aid in getting a more even representation of the animal, a video can be created showing the animal at play. This video is uploaded to DropBox and a printed page is generated with a QR code link to the video. The page also serves as an Augmented Reality Image Target.

A demostration can be seen here:
